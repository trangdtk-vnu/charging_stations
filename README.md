## üó∫Ô∏è **Project Overview**  

Our project focuses on the following key objectives:  

1. **Understanding EVCS Demand**  
   - Geographical and socio-economic variables serve as essential indicators for understanding EV charging needs.  

2. **Building a Big Data Framework**  
   - We compile a rich dataset integrating **socio-demographic** and **geospatial features** of Italy.  
   - Using **Big Data processing pipelines**, we analyze and process extensive datasets efficiently.  

3. **Optimizing EVCS Placement**  
   - Classical Machine Learning algorithms are employed to evaluate multiple models.  
   - Performance comparison helps identify the most effective approach for optimal EVCS placement.

## **Acknowledgments**
We extend our sincere gratitude to Akansh Maurya, Cicy Kuriakose Agnes, Bahram Khan Baloch, Saira Sohail Anwari, and Umer Butt for their invaluable contribution to the field of EV charging infrastructure placement. Their methodology, as presented in "Spatial-Economic Analysis for Optimal Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement" at the 2024 International Conference on Social and Sustainable Innovations in Technology and Engineering (SASI-ITE), provided a foundational framework that significantly informed and enriched our approach.

We appreciate their detailed exploration of machine learning, spatial-economic analysis, and the utilization of Open Street Map data, which served as critical references in developing our own big data framework for optimal EVCS placement in Italy.

Their pioneering work continues to inspire advancements in sustainable infrastructure planning and decision-making.
